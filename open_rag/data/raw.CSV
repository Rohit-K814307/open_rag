	I don't think I have heard from you two at all, after our big meeting.  I had asked you - directly and thru your parents - to send me the answers to the problems I sent you after that meeting.  You can send them as and when you solve the problem(s), remembering to time yourself on each problem.  Don't worry if some of them seem too difficult at this stage.  

	When you send me the answers, include the time (for example, 2:37 for two minutes, 37 seconds) it took you to solve each problem.

	Now that school's over (?), you can begin to focus on the problems.

	Have you prepared those four tables (squares, cubes, powers of 2 and factorials)?  How about fining new words from the paper?

Subject: Our class on Sunday - 12 to 2:30 or so

 

Dear Students (and Parents),

 

I hope you all had a good summer, including travel to India for some of you.  We had a good one, including travel to Seattle, Vancouver and a just-concluded trip to New York for the US Open.  The highlight was having our two grandsons - ages 8 and 6 - spend nine days with us last month.  

 

I am sorry (maybe you are glad!) I was not able to send you more problems after the multiple exchanges on the 100-problem diagnostic.  This note is in preparation for our first class this Sunday at noon.

 

Diagnostic:  Could each of you please send me the #s of the problems you were not able to solve (or took too long to solve)?   Please send them before you go to bed tomorrow night.  

 

Algebra:  While all of you have indicated you have completed Algebra I, I have some reservations about your mastery of basic Algebra concepts. 


While this will not come in the way of your learning Geometry or Trigonometry, it will certainly come in the way of Precalc and Calculus later on.  With that in view, I plan to spend some time on these concepts early on.  As you know, mastery of algebra is critical to any future study and work in many fields.

 

Word Counts:  When you write to me tomorrow, please give me your latest word count.   And make that a habit - i.e., sending me your latest Word Count.  My general impression is that many of you may have slacked off and may not have much to show me!  Maybe you'll surprise me!   Please also let me know if you now have a subscription to the Washington Post.  

 

Geometry syllabus:  If one of you has this handy, could you please send it to me tomorrow morning?   If there is assigned homework, send that as well.  Just copy the others on your note, so that others don't have to send me multiple duplicates.

 

I am very excited (are you?!?) about getting to know you all better and, more important, setting forth on this joint learning process;  you can all expect to improve your algebra, learn geometry and improve your English skills.   But this can happen only if we work together.

 

Let me know if you (that includes the parents) have any questions.  When you write to me, please try to write in full sentences.  The longer your note, the better.  That is how one improves one's writing skills, even as you increase your comfort level with written communication.  Don't feel bad if I send you comments on your writing from time to time - correcting your spelling, syntax, grammar, etc.  

 

I can't wait for Sunday noon!

 

Madhavan

Dear Students,

I am sorry I couldn't send this earlier.  I realize you could have used your free time today to finish this.

Please remember to time yourself on each problem or sub-problem and set it down next to your answer.   Do not be embarrassed if it takes you longer that what you think is the average.   The time stays with me, you and your parents, and will not be shares with anyone else.    And times will improve with practice, I promise!   And do not forget to add to your word collection and to send your word count as well.

Also, I have received three class summaries, all of which are excellent.  I have not had a chance to review them in detail to catch any mistakes or misstatements;  I'll do that by tomorrow.  When I asked you to send me a summary of each class the same day, it was to help you retain the information; just the process of looking thru your notes and trying to summarize what you learned by writing it down helps in long-term retention.  I would like others to join this group.  You can still send me the summaries.

98. Given: y = x^2 - 8x - k

Evaluate the discriminant for the following cases and indicate the # of roots:
a) if k = 5
b) if k = -20
c) if k = 16
Note that for each of the three cases, two answers are sought: the value of the discriminant and the # of roots.

99. For each of the three cases above, find the roots.  

100.  a) Plot any one of the three cases in 1, and figure out the equation of the axis of symmetry for that parabola.

Note that every parabola has an axis of symmetry.  If you fold the paper along the axis of symmetry, one part of the parabola lies exactly over the other part.  This means that if you start with the x-value where y reaches a minimum (or maximum), moving k units to the right and k units to the left will result in y having the same value.  This is easier seen on paper or on screen.

b) What determines whether a parabola has a minimum or maximum value?

101. y = x^2 - 10x + 16, 
a) Find the value of x for which y reaches a minimum value.  
b) And what is that minimum value?
As part of learning, I suggest you draw up a table with two rows labeled x and y.  Find y for values of x in the range of 0 to 10.  Just try the integer values for now.  See format of suggested table below (even if the image doesn't come thru, you should be able to do this problem).

			y = x^2 - 10x + 16
								
x	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	
y												
d) Is there a direct way to figure out that x-value?  If yes, show how.

e) Once you have found the x-value for which y reaches a minimum, can you write down the equation for the axis of symmetry?

102. You add 120 to the square of a positive integer, and end up with the square of another positive integer.  Find all possible solutions.
This is a variant of what we did in class (adding 100 or 400).

103. You add 20 to the square of a positive number, and end up with the square of another positive number.  Find all possible solutions.  Pay careful attention to the wording, and compare it to that in #102.   I am reasonably certain that some of you may not list all possible solutions.  That is a hint!

104.  It is dosa time again!  See image below.
What is the ratio of the area of the big dosa to that of the big square?
And what is the ratio of the areas of the four dosas to that of the big square?


105. You scored 91, 96, 97 and 92 in the first four of five tests.  What must you score on the fifth and final test for you to get an overall average of 95?  See if you can apply the deficit/surplus method to solve this in about 10 seconds.

106. Expand (x+y)^3.
One of these days, we'll learn how to directly write down the answer (without any complicated calculations) to (x+y)^n, where n could be any integer.

107. Expand (x-y)^3
Compare this answer to the answer to 106, and see what is the same and what is different.

Good luck!

Madhavan

"Re: Pascals triangle","Yes! Already sent it and cleared up the pascals triangle thing in the email. (I used it for the expansion question!) I also checked with the normal way and it was correct! I believe it is used for the coefficients of the expansion.

	You are the only one who has responded to my questions on Pascal's triangle.  :-)    But you have not answered my three questions.  What you have written may be your answer to the 2nd of the three questions, but it is not clear.  

	Will you be sending me the answers to HW 7-1 tonight?  I have heard from four of the six (of which, one came yesterday).

I had a question for you, What is the sum of all the positive integers? Read more!
My sister told me about something called the Riemann Zeta Function and how it shows that all the positive integers added together is equal to -1/12. I was wondering if you could explain this concept in class.

			Dear Mr. Madhavan,
			1. i do not understand, do you mean where the parabolas touch

		Intersection means they cut each other.  Touching each other is also included in that, but they are not touching each other here.   Set the two expressions on the right of the = sign equal to each other.  Why?  Because when they intersect, the coordinates of the point(S) of intersection are the same.

			2. again. help

		2a. Since the point(s) of intersection have the same coordinates, set the expressions for y equal to solve for x and then find y for that x. 
		2b. Find the coordinates of the vertex and find the two distances.  If you don't know the distance formula, look for a right angle and apply the Pyth. theorem.

"Summary of class 11","Dear Mr. Madhavan
Yesterday, I learned about the formula for permutations n!/(n-r)!, the combinations formula n!/r1(n-r)!, and what notations there are for combinations. I cannot write these because some are written as subscripts but I will do two. ncr= n choose r and (n)

		Akshaya,

		Rohit has just sent me some photo attachments of his work on some HW problems.  But they are not oriented the right way, and there is no easy way for me to rotate them by 90 degrees for easy review.  

		Your pictures have not had that problem, I think.  Do you copy-paste them or what exactly do you do?

		I am copying Rohit on this so he can do what you do, if it is easy to do.

"questions for ROHIT","Dear Students,

Here is HW 12-1, due by 6 pm Thursday.  Thanks will be given!  Get it?  ;-)


No answers will be entertained without times for each problem!   I may return the answers to your parents if there are no times!   Do not be embarrassed if a problem takes more than what you think is the average.  Only your parents and I will be privy (new word?) to whatever you send me, including the times.


1. a) How many 4-letter ""words"" can you form out of the letters in POLE, with no letters to be repeated?
    b) What if letters can be repeated?

2. a) The four letters are POOL.  How many four-letter words can you make, using all four letters in each word?

    b) Is this the same as problem 1a?  Explain.

3  a) How many four-letter words can you form out of the letters A-D. using all four letters?
    b) How many four-letter words can you form out of the letters in NOON. using all four letters?
    c) Why are the two answers not the same?  What is the relationship between the two answers?

4. How many handshakes take place in a group of 10, if everyone shakes hands with every one else?  Solve this using combinations.

5. How many diagonals are there in a) a pentagon and b) a hexagon.  Solve this using combinations.

6. What are the coordinates of the intersection point(s) between px^2 + qx + r and rx^2 + qx + p?  
You should be able to write them down without much calculation (we did this in class today).

7. 43^2=1849   48^2=2304  54^2=2916.  What is the short-cut to these calculations?
Can you do 46^2 and 57^2 in 10 seconds?

8. Can you show me how to find 11^3 and 21^3 without directly calculating, but using one of the identities we learned last week?

9. Factor (x^16-65536)

10. A fly and an ant are at vertex A on the inside of a hollow cube of edge 1 unit.  What are the lengths of the paths of the fly and of the ant, if they take the shortest paths to a speck of sugar at the diagonally opposite corner G?   


11. What is the sum of all the five-digit numbers than can be formed using the digits 1-5, if he digits cannot be repeated?  

12. A family has two sets of twins.  How many ways can the family of six sit on a bench if the four children cannot all be seated in four consecutive seats?

13. How many numbers are there between 100 and 1000 such that every digit is either 4 or 5?

14. How many integers between 1 and 1000 are neither multiples of 2 nor 3?

15. What is the smallest number that can be divided evenly by each of the first 9 positive integers?

16. Find two numbers, neither containing any zeros, whose product is 1 billion.

17. A ribbon is tied snugly around the equator (25,000 mls long, say).  You cut it and insert 100' of extra ribbon.  The ribbon is now uniformly spread around the earth so that it is the same distance away from the earth at all points.  Which of the following animals do you think can pass under the ribbon while walking erect (i.e., no crawling)?  
a) ant b) cat c)  dog e) goat f) cow g) horse h) elephant i) giraffe    

You may be surprised at the answer.

18. In how many ways can 4 boys and 3 girls be seated so that boys and girls alternate?

19.  If 1/3rd of a number is 3 more than 1/4th of the number, what is the number?

20. If 1/3rd of the number of girls in a school equals 1/5th of the total number of students, what is the ratio of girls to boys in the schools?


Good luck!


Madhavan

		1.4 words 1 min 29 sec

	Why only four?  POLE, POEL, PEOL, PELO are four.  There are a lot more.   Is it perm or comb problem?  Use the formula.  Or put down four dashes for the four letter positions and solve using first principles.  How many choices for 1st position/  How many for ....?

	Good, but wouldn't it be simpler to break up 11 into 10+1?.  And 21 into 20 and 1?     Practice that.  Also, try to do 19^3 and 29^3.

"Summary of week 12","Dear Mr. Madhavan,

I have learned a few things this class. I have learned about cubic polynomials and how to find the sum of the roots you have to do the opposite of a quadratic. I have also learned about how to find the last two digits of a square number between 40 and 60. I have learned about primes and how to find if a number is prime by seeing how many times the number has to be divided by smaller primes by finding the closest square root of the number.

Greetings Students and Parents! All Panther and Tiger String students are invited to perform and enjoy a day at Hersheypark on Friday, June 5, 2020. This is a fantastic day where our entire music department travels to perform and represent JML at Music in the Parks Competition and has a fun day at the theme park riding rides in chaperoned groups. Our string groups will perform the music we are currently preparing for VBODA Orchestra Assessment.

Use this link to learn how to REGISTER NOW <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fg_8G9VW7lxVbbB0jO2nOiw6llgXOFum/view?usp=sharing> !

Please talk it over with your family to determine if you are available on Friday, June 5 for this exciting performance opportunity! The total price of this trip is determined by the total number of students attending so we are asking for the $100 deposit by April 1, 2020. Any remaining balance will be collected by May 15, 2020 and will be between $30-50 depending on the number of students registered by April 1.

Thanks for the prompt response.  Again, you are the 1st to respond!

 

Is your laptop touch-sensitive?  Probably not, but it would be nice if it were.

 

I take it that the Curie streaming is one-way - from them to you - and that there is no way for students to respond.

Subject: South Riding - getting ready for on-line sessions - skype and 1.awwapp.com 2. liveboard.com 3. miro.com

 

Dear Students,


 

Following up on yesterday's note, this is to ask you all to download skype onto your touch-sensitive devices.  It takes just a minute or two.   If you are new to skype, it might be good practice for you to call one of your classmates (our group or anyone outside the group) as a way to get familiar with skype.

 

Also, go to the three whiteboard collaboration software websites I mentioned yesterday and spend a few minutes getting familiar with the layout.  You don't need to sign up;  I will sign up with a master account and send you invitations to join the session.

1. awwapp.com <http://awwapp.com> 

2. liveboard.com <http://liveboard.com> 

3. miro.com <http://miro.com> 

 

Tomorrow and Friday, I would like to have individual skype audio (optional video, if I am clean-shaven by then!) sessions with each of you not for learning but to introduce you to how our sessions might work.    We will then sign on to each of the three websites and simulate (a new word?) a learning session.  What remains to be seen is how the two work together: whether skype stays in the background, while the whiteboard app takes over the screen.

 

I see one big advantage with such sessions:  you are as close to the ""board"" as I am, and so we'll waste no time when I ask any of you to show your solutions on the board!  In class, I was limiting this because of the time it takes each of you to come to the board.  Also, if you know you are going to show your solution to others, you'll spend more time thinking about each step.

 

Until we all have styluses, we'll use our fingers to write on our devices.

 

Please let me know once you have downloaded skype.  Give me the times that are good for you over the next two days (e.g., all day both days,  10 to 12 and 2 to 5, etc.) for the two of us to have a one-on-one session to test out how the process might work and to work out the kinks (new word?).

 

Once I have had the six one-on-one sessions, we'll have a joint test session, maybe on Friday, to see if we have any band-width problems with seven people on skype simultaneously.  I don't anticipate any, if we stick to audio.  Switching to video runs into the risk of bandwidth limitations (it is similar to having too many cars on a four-lane road).

 

I have not had a chance to create HW 23.  It may come your way in the next 24 hours, if I can find the time.

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Stay safe and healthy!

 

Madhavan

Subject: South Riding - an interesting problem

 

This is a problem I have received from one of you.  I have modified the problem a bit in order to give it some structure.

 

(a^2 + b^2)/(ab +1) = k, where k is an integer.

 

Solve for a and b.

 

Good luck!

 

Madhavan

Constructed Response 

11.  The concepts of both authors are similar because they both talk about how fiction is helpful and can change your perspectives on ideas.



12.  In line 31, the author says that a fiction is ""effective at changing beliefs"". This means that fiction can change your thoughts and ideas.




13.  In lines 61 and 62, the author says that "" fictional reading activates neuronal pathways"". This means that fiction makes your brain grow and progress thus changing your perspectives on ideas.



14. In passage b, lines 61-62, the author states that by reading fiction, you can  ""understand real human emotion"". Passage a talks about how you can grow your mind through fiction reading.



15. I learned that fiction can help greatly when you want to grow your mind. It can also help you open new neuronal pathways to understand real human emotion.

I spent the entire morning until lunch on the test. Then I slept because I woke up very early and slept late study and revising the subjects. Then I started on an essay for curie. You can wait as long as you can for the hw but I might not submit it because I have to eat dinner and then sleep. I will submit tomorrow in the morning however. Sorry for the delay!

"Summary of class","Dear Mr. Madhavan,

In this class, I learned about fitting a polynomial to imaginary roots and how you can derive another root from an imaginary root because they go in pairs. I learned about how to find the difference of consecutive cubes and the numbers using 1729, which is Ramanujan's number. I learned about how to find the speed of a person who has traveled a certain distance for a certain amount time. I learned about the sum of cubes and the cubes that add up to a certain number. 

Thank you,
Rohit

"Summary of class","Dear Mr. Madhavan,

This class I learned all about cos, sin, tangent. I learned how to use (cos(a))^2 + (sin(a))^2 = 1.
This can be used when finding a cos of a certain value. I learned that cos, sin, and tangent can be written in a graph. I learned about how to find the distance a car goes if it is accelerating at a certain speed. I also learned about how to find the height of a triangle. When you draw the line of the height, you are given two right triangles. So to find the height, all you need to do is say that sin of a, the bottom most lower angle, is equal to the height over the hypotenuse. Here is what I mean <https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1N3TpBe3s67xED13dcRH888OsUugmJM6e7K_47e4AOm8/edit?usp=sharing> .

"South Riding - HW 28-1 - Rohit","Dear Mr. Madhavan,

Below are my answers to the HW

1. Car A at point P moves toward point Q from zero initial speed and an acceleration of 10 ft per sec per second.   Car B at point Q moves toward point P at a speed of 100 fps.
The two cars meet in 10 seconds.








a) What is the distance PQ?


1500 ft.    1:07




b) How much does each of the cars travel by that time?

A = 500 ft. 0:08
B = 1000 ft. 0:05




2.  Car A at point P moves toward point Q from zero initial speed and an acceleration of 10 ft per sec per second.   Car B at point Q moves toward point P at a speed of 100 fps.
The two cars meet at point R, midway between P and Q.






a) What is the distance PQ?


2000 ft. 1:32




b) How long does it take for the two cars to meet?


20 seconds 1:07




3. In problem #2, in addition to the two cars, there is a stone that is thrown from point A at the same time as the two cars start moving;  it is thrown at an angle to the horizontal such that it goes up and comes down at point R at the same time as the two cars. 






a) What is the vertical component of the stone's velocity?


320 ft./sec  1:04




b) What is its horizontal component

50 ft./sec  0:23








4. A stone is thrown up with velocity V fps at an angle A - to the horizontal - from a point whose coordinates are, say (0,0).





a) Express the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola that the stone traces using these two values and any other constants.


(v x (cos(A)), v x sin(A)) 1:23








b) Express the coordinates of the point where it lands.


(2(v x (cos(a))),0) !:46








5. If (cos A)^2 - (sin A)^2 = 0.7, 




    a) find the value of (cos A)^4 - (sin A)^4? 


0.698912  1:09


    b) What is sin A?


        0.388 0:23


    c) Find the value of A (by hand)
      
       A = (cos^(-1) x (0.7))/2  3:42
     



Above shows the common way we write (sin (t))^2 and (cos(t))^2.  On computers, it may not always be easy to produce exponents and subscripts; hence the cumbersome notation using parentheses.  When you write such expressions on paper, use the above notation.








6. Fill in the blank cells in the table below.
  

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS QUESTION COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE A CLUE

a) What is the velocity of the ball, and
500  1:07




b) What is the measure of the angle theta?  You may have to be creative here.
Hint: Use the Pythagorean theorem. 



0.75 degrees 0:54






8. Raj has just gotten his driver's license.  He gets into his grandfather's Tesla, and accelerates steadily for two minutes until he reaches a speed of 60 mph.

9. A triangle whose sides are p, q and r has an area A sq units.
HELP ON ALL 






a) What are the lengths of the three altitudes or heights?












b) How would you use basic trig to find the three angles?   








10. Raj, Jai and Parag are at the three vertices of a triangle. Raj throws a ball to Jai, Jai to Parag and Parag to Jai.  Their balls stay in the air for 30, 20 and 10 seconds respectively.


Help on all






a) What is the sum of the heights reached by the three balls?








b) If the horizontal components of the three balls are 100, 200 and 300 fps, what is the perimeter of the triangle?

"South Riding - HW 28-1 - full solutions","Dear Students,



Here are the full solutions to HW 28-1.   Do go thru them in detail and make sure you understand every step of every problem; work them out on ppaer, instead of just reading them.  HW 28-2 that may be coming tonight may have problems similar to these so you can become better at these types of problems.


Last Sunday, one of you admitted you hadn't gone thru the solutions!  That came as a big disappointment to me.  I hope I am not disappointed in that manner ever again.


Madhavan


Dear Students,


1. Car A at point P moves toward point Q from zero initial speed and an acceleration of 10 ft per sec per second.   Car B at point Q moves toward point P at a speed of 100 fps.
The two cars meet in 10 seconds.

a) What is the distance PQ?
b) How much does each of the cars travel by that time?


d1 = 1/2at^2 = 5*10^2 = 500'.
d2 = vt = 100*10 = 1000'
d1 + d2 = 1500'

2.  Car A at point P moves toward point Q from zero initial speed and an acceleration of 10 ft per sec per second.   Car B at point Q moves toward point P at a speed of 100 fps.
The two cars meet at point R, midway between P and Q.
a) What is the distance PQ?


d1 = 1/2at^2 = 5t^2
d2 = vt = 100t
d1 = d2, since the cars midway.
5t^2 = 100t -> 5t =100 -> t = 20 seconds.
PQ = twice d2 = 2 *100*20 = 4000'


b) How long does it take for the two cars to meet?


In 20 seconds (see 2 a)


3. In problem #2, in addition to the two cars, there is a stone that is thrown from point A P at the same time as the two cars start moving;  it is thrown at an angle to the horizontal such that it goes up and comes down at point R at the same time as the two cars. 
a) What is the vertical component of the stone's velocity?


The cars take 20 seconds to meet.  
So, the stone must spend 10 seconds to go up (and 10 seconds to come down).
At the end of the 10-second climb, its vertical speed is zero. So, its initial vertical speed is 32*10 = 320 fps.

b) What is its horizontal component?


In 20 seconds, the stone must go 2000' horizontally.  So, its horizontal speed must be 2000/20 = 100 fps.


Note:  If you have solved #2 correctly, #3 can be done almost in your head.


4. A stone is thrown up with velocity V fps at an angle A - to the horizontal - from a point whose coordinates are, say (0,0).
a) Express the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola that the stone traces using these two values and any other constants.


Vertical component = V*sin A and horizontal component = V *cos A or V cosA 
Time to reach top = V Sin A/32 (make sure you fully understand why this is so).
So,  max height = avg speed * time to reach max height = (V Sin A)/2 * V Sin A/32 = V^2 (sin A)^2/64
(you'll recall we discussed this formula on Sunday, where we said max height = V^2/64, where V was the vertical component. Here V Sin A is that vertical component).
Horizontal distance (not time) (from 4b) at max height = 1/2 of total distance reached = V^2 * sin A * cos A/32


So, coordinates of the vertex are: (V^2 * sin A * cos A/32,  V^2 (sin A)^2/64)
Again, make sure you fully understand where all the Vs, sin A, cos As come from.  Don't try to memorize this until you have fully understood it.
The V2/64 as the max height shd be memorized (here V is the vertical component); note that if the ball is thrown up vertically at a velocity of V, the vertical component is also V.


b) Express the coordinates of the point where it lands.


Time in air = twice time to reach top = 2 * (V sin A)/32 = V * (Sin A)/16
Horizontal distance reached = Horizontal speed * time in air = V*(cos A) * V * (sin A)/16 = V^2* Sin A * Cos A/16

So, coordinates of the landing point are: (V^2 * sin A * cos A/16,  0)

5. If (cos A)^2 - (sin A)^2 = 0.7, 
    a) find the value of (cos A)^4 - (sin A)^4? 


Using the identity a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b), we get:
(cos A)^4 - (sin A)^4 = {(cos A)^2 + (sin A)^2} * {(cos A)^2 - (sin A)^2} = 1 * 0.7 = 0.7, since (cos A)^2 + (sin A)^2 = 1



    b) What is sin A?


Given (cos A)^2 - (sin A)^2 = 0.7,  1 - (sin A)^2 - (sin A)^2 = 1 - 2 (sin A)^2 = 0.7 -> 2 (Sin A)^2 = 0.3 ->
-> (sin A)^2 = 0.15 -> SIn A = sqrt(0.15) = 0.387...
Note:  

Above shows the common way we write (sin (t))^2 and (cos(t))^2.  On computers, it may not always be easy to produce exponents and subscripts; hence the cumbersome notation using parentheses.  When you write such expressions on paper, use the above notation.


    c) Find the value of A (both thru TI calculator and thru desmos)


Now, we need to find the angle whose sine is 0.387...
Two ways to find this angle.
i) TI calculator:  Enter the value. Press INV (for inverse) or 2nd (depending on the calc), then press the key Sin^(-1) to have the angle displayed.
ii) Use desmos.  Plot the sine curve (y = sin x).  Plot y=0.387.  Point to the intersection to have the angle displayed. See below.




Clicking this graphic will most likely magnify it for better readability.


The angle is 22.768 degrees.
Caution: in desmos, you have to set the angle setting to degrees and not radians; as noted earlier, this is a very common mistake.  Also, change the x- and y-axis settings for the appropriate ranges.  
 is the icon - at top right - for changing graph settings in desmos.



Advanced technique:  Taylor series can be used to calculate the angle, but it will be expressed in radians (π radians = 180 degrees).


Here, the sin x with an exponent of -1 is not really 1/(sin x); it is not an exponent, even though it looks like one.  Instead it means the angle whose sign is a given value.   Taylor, McLaurin and other series are really advanced topics, and are probably covered in HS, if at all.  Ask your older siblings or uour parents if they have learned this.  There are many other series besides these two.

6. Fill in the blank cells in the table below.


a) sin A = 0.4; cos A = sqrt[1- (sin A)^2] = √(1-0.16) = √(0.84 = 0.9165..  Here, we used the identity:  (sin A)^2 = (cos A)^2 = 1
Alternatively, if sin A =0.4, draw a rt-triangle with hypotenuse of 10 and opposite side of 4 (4/10 = 0.4), or any other two values whose ratio is 0.4.
So, the third side is sqrt(10^2 - 4^2) = sqrt(100-16) = sqrt(84)=2*sqrt(21).  So, cos A = 2*sqrt(21)/10 = sqrt(21)/5.
tan A = sin A/cos A = 0.4/0.9165 = 0.4364.  Do you know why tan A = sin A/cos A?    Just use soh-cah-toa.


b) cos A = 0.6.  Use the trig identity that adds up to 1 (used above).


c) tan A= 2.  Draw a right triangle with two sides forming the right angle 2 and 1.  The sides forming the right angle are sometimes called the ""legs"". Take it from there.


7. A ball is thrown up at an angle theta.  If the vertical and horizontal components are 300 and 400 fps respectively,
a) What is the velocity of the ball?


Let v be the velocity of the ball at angle theta.
Vertical component = v*sin theta.
Horizontal component = v*cos theta.
Square both to get v^2 (sin theta)^2 + v^2 * (cos theta)^2 = v^2 [(sin theta)^2 + cos(theta)^2}
=v^2, since the expression in parentheses equals 1.
So, v^2 = 300^2 + 400^2 = 100^2*(3^2 + 4^2) = 100^2*25.
So, v = sqrt(100^2*25) = 100*5 = 500 fps.


That was the long way.  The short way is if you recognized that 300 and 400 are part of the Pythagorean triple (300,400,500).  

b) What is the measure of the angle theta?  You may have to be creative here.
Hint: Use the Pythagorean theorem. 



sin theta = 300/500 = 0.6.
sin^(-1) 0.6 (read as sin inverse of 0.6) = 36.87...degrees.

8. Raj has just gotten his driver's license.  He gets into his grandfather's Tesla, and accelerates steadily for two minutes until he reaches a speed of 60 mph.   He then cruises at that speed for 10 minutes, then decelerates steadily until he comes to a full stop in one minute.
a) How far does he travel?


a) Do we need to know what the acceleration is?  Not really.  But if you are curious, Raj's speed goes up from 0 to 60 mph in two minutes, or 30 mph/second or 2.5 mph/minute.  Having calculate this, you can use d = 1/2 at^2 to get the distance.


What is the average speed of this first leg (L+H)/2, or (0+60)/2 = 30 mph.
Distance of this first leg = avg speed * time (in hours) = 30 * 2/60 = 1 mile.
Next 10 minutes at a steady speed of 60 mph (or a mile a minute) -> 10 miles traveled
Minute 13 - speed 60 mph to zero speed ->average = 30 mph; distance = 30*1/60 = 0.5 mile.
Total miles covered = 1 + 10 + 0.5 = 11.5 miles.




b) What is his average speed?


 Average speed = distance divided by time = 11.5/13*60 = 690/13 = 53 1/13 mph



9. A triangle whose sides are p, q and r has an area A sq units.
a) What are the lengths of the three altitudes or heights?


Some of you assumed a right triangle.  There is no basis to make that assumption.


What is the area of any triangle?  Area = 1/2 base times height.  So, consider the side of length p as the base (any of the sides could be considered to be the base).   If the height to side p from the opposite vertex is x, area A = px/2 -> x = 2A/p.  Similarly, the other two heights are 2A/q and 2A/r.  As simple as that!


Practice example:


In the triangle above, the lengths of the three sides (red, green and blue) are 5, 5 and √20, and the area is 10.
(note: if this isosceles triangle doesn't look like one, it is because the y-axis scale is not the same as the x-axis scale).


One of the altitude or heights has been drawn in, but there are two other heights (on the blue and the green bases).
For practice, figure out the three heights.

b) How would you use basic trig to find the three angles?   


This is where Rohit was heading toward the end of last class, when I asked him to stop for fear of him giving you all the answer!
Sin of an angle = opposite/hypotenuse.  In the above triangle, all the angles are acute angles, and so this definition cannot be applied.
But with the altitude or height drawn in, do you see the two right triangles?
Use them to get sines of the two angles at the end of the red line (sine = ht/length of green line or ht/length of blue line).
If you draw another altitude from one of the ends of the red line, you can get the sign of the angle of the top.
Now you have the sine values of the three angles.  You now have to use sine inverse function in your calculator (after making sure it is in the degrees mode) to find the measures of the three angles.


This leads to a very useful identity that applies to any triangle:  a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C, where the side opposite angle A is a, etc.  To use this identity, you ned to know at least one angle in the triangle.


10. Raj, Jay and Parag are at the three vertices of a triangle. Raj throws a ball to Jay, Jay to Parag and Parag to Jay.  Their balls stay in the air for 30, 20 and 10 seconds respectively.
a) What is the sum of the heights reached by the three balls?


If a ball stays in the air for 30 seconds, it goes up for half that time, with the other half spent coming down (from symmetry of parabolas).
How far does a ball drop in 15 (half of 30) seconds, from a position of rest?  1/2at^2.
So, Raj - 1/2at^2 = 16*15^2 = 16*225 = 3,600'.
Jay: 16*10^2 = 1,600'.
Parag: 16*5^2 = 400'.
Total = 3600+1600+400 = 5,600'.
Another way: 16(15^2+10^2+5^2) = 16(225+100+25)=16*350=5,600'.

b) If the horizontal components of the three balls are 100, 200 and 300 fps, what is the perimeter of the triangle?


Raj: Horizontal distance = horizontal speed * time in air = 100*30 = 3,000'.
Jay: 200*20 = 4,000'.
Parag: 300*10 = 3,000'.
Total distance = perimeter of triangle = 10,000' (almost two miles!)

c) What is the area of the triangle?


The three sides of the triangle are: 3000, 4000 & 3000.
Two ways to calculate the area:
i) Take advantage of the fact that the triangle is an isosceles triangle.
If the base is 4,000', and the two equal sides are 3000', drop a perpendicular from the vertex opposite side 4000' onto the base.
This bisects the base.  Use Pythagorean theorem to calculate the height or the length of the perpendicular.
Since all sides are multiples of 1000, deal with a triangle of sides 3,4,3.   Height = sqrt(3^2 - 2^2)=sqrt(5).
Area = 1/2 base * height = 1/2 * 4 * √5 = 2√5.
Now, the sides of our triangle are 1,000 times (3,4,3).  So, its area is not just 1,000 times the area of the (3,4,3) triangle.
Instead, it is 1000*1000 times the area.  So the required area = 1,000,000*2√5=2,000,000√5.
Note: In case you had forgotten, if you multiply all sides of any figure - not just a triangle - by a factor of k, the area gets multiplied by a factor of k^2.


ii) Use Heron's formula.   Area - sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c), where s is the semi-perimeter and a, b and c are the lengths of the three sides.
So, dealing with the smaller triangle (3,4,3), with a semi-perimeter of 5, 
we get: area = sqrt{5*(5-4)*(5-3)(5-3)] = sqrt(5*1*2*2)= sqrt(20) = 2√5.
Since the sides of the larger triangle are 1,000 times as large, the area would be 1000^2 as large, or 2,000,000√5. 


d) Express the three speeds in mph.  Are they realistic speeds?


Some useful constants:
The usual speed on highways is 60 mph (""mile a minute"") or 60*5280/3600 = 88 fps.
30 mph = 44 fps and 15 mph = 22 fps.  1 mph = 22/15 fps.
From 1 mph = 22/15 fps, we get 1 fps = 15/22 mph.
Raj: 100 fps = 100*15/22 = 1500/22 = 750/11 = 68 2/11 mph.
Jay: 200 fps = 2* 68 2/11 = 136 4/11 mph.
Parag: 300 fps = 3 * 68 2/11 = 204 6/11 mph.
Other than Raj's horizontal speed, the other two are not realistic.  And when you are told that Raj and Jay are only 9 and 6, you'll realize that those are even more unrealistic!
Those of you that watch tennis would probably know that the fastest server serves at around 155-160 mph (Andy Roddick at 155 mph).  In ping pong, max speed is around 65 mph.  Cricket - one of you or one of your parents might know.
Also, looking at how high the balls go, no human can throw balls as high as 3,000', 1,600' or even 400'.  Give it a try the next time you are on a ball field. 
Also, if you figure out the air-time of your thrown ball, you can figure out the maximum height.  To figure out the horizontal range, you either need the horizontal component, or you need a long tape measure!  Once you know the horizontal range, you can figure out your horizontal component.


Good luck!

"South Riding - HW 28-2 - Rohit","Dear Mr. Madhavan,

Sky-diving:  I have done nine skydives in all (and one indoor skydive in Las Vegas) - two in Canada and the others in Pittsburgh.   I stopped this activity when I smelled alcohol in my instructor's breath at 9 am (!) on a Saturday morning.   Beginners generally jump from an altitude/height of 2,800', and our chutes (parachutes) are opened automatically by a static line attached to a hook in the plane.  After the first three so-called ""static line"" jumps, one progresses to ""free fall"" jumps, where you are falling free like a stone - accelerating at 32 feet per second per second - until you decide to deploy (open) the chute.


1. Skydiver Madhavan does a freefall jump from 7500'.  He deploys his chute at 5000' and drifts down at 15 mph vertically from that point on.




a) How long is the freefall?
12 1/2 seconds 1:07


c) What is his freefall speed just before the chute is opened?
400 feet per second  0:15

b) How long is the gentle second half of the ride down, measured vertically?


I did not know whether you meant long as in time or distance so I did both.


333 1/3 seconds 0:42
5000 feet 0:08








2. A stone is dropped from near the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa - i.e., from a height of 2500'.  At the same time, a stone is thrown up vertically from a balcony at a height of 1500 and at a speed of 150 fps.




a) When will the two stones be at the same height?
9 3/8 seconds 2:07


b) What will be the time difference between the two stones hitting the ground?
help.








3. Every day, you give me $32, starting May 1, at which time, I have no money at all.  Four days later, you and I have the same amount of money.




a) How much money did you have on May 1?
$256 0:48


b) How much does each of us have on May 5?
$128 0:07




4. Akshaya drops a stone from the top of a tower. At the same time, Jasmin throws up a stone vertically from the ground..  When the two stones meet in four seconds, they have the same speed.  




a) What speed is that?
128 feet per second 0:17


b) What was the initial speed of the stone that was thrown up?
256 feet per second---- I just  realized that 3 and 4 are the same! they have the same answers!


c) Do you see the connection between Problems 3 & 4?


Yes basically what the connection is is that 32 dollars is ""Gravity"", and each ""second"" (day) the ""Speed"" (rate of the money being given away) lessens as the stones or money go higher in altitude and amount






5. Eshwar throws a ball to Maadhavan, Maadhavan then throws it to Reyhan, then Reyhan to Rohit, and finally Rohit throws it back to Eshwar.
The balls stay in the air for 1, 2, 3 and 4 seconds respectively.




a) What is the sum of the heights reached by the four balls?
480 feet 0:52


b) If the horizontal speeds of the balls are 40, 30, 20 and 10 fps respectively, what is the perimeter of the quadrilateral ABCD?
200 feet 0:27


c) What is the area of the quadrilateral if AC is 30'?
1200 square feet 0:31








6. A ball is thrown up at an angle A to the horizontal.   If the vertical and horizontal components are 80 and 150 fps respectively,



a) What is the velocity of the ball?
1200 ft./second 2:23

b) What is the measure of the angle A?
help








7. Fill in the blanks in the table below.
			sin (A)	cos(A)	tan(A)	
sin (A)	0.6		0.6	0.8	6/8	
cos(A)	0.3		
√91/10	
0.3	
√91/3	
tan(A)	1.5		3/13	2/13	1.5	
 




8. Maadhavan's dad gets into his Tesla and accelerates steadily for four minutes until he reaches a speed of 60 mph.  He cruises at this speed
for 40 minutes and brakes/decelerates steadily for three minutes until he comes to a full stop.




a) How far did he travel?
16567.5 miles 2:23


b) What was his average speed?
30 mph








9. A triangle whose sides are x, y and z has an area of A sq units.




a) What are the lengths of the three altitudes?
they can be anything


b) If the three angles are 30, 60 and 90, how can you find the lengths of the altitudes using just trig?



if it is 30,60,90 it is a right triangle so there is only one altitude that would be either 30 or 60 feet. however with trig, you could find the length by using angle theta. Sin of angle theta would be a certain value and based on that you could use the numerator to find the value of the side length which is the altitude.






10. How many of the prime integers below 50 can be expressed as the sum of two squares of positive integers?  List them and show the two squares.  Example: 5 = 4 + 1 = 2^2 + 1^2.
Wouldn't it be all prime numbers below 50 other than two? I do not know

Thank you,
Rohit

 ground is not counted).



8. If you want the ball to reach 250' of range, give me two combinations of speed
 (V fps) and angle A that will achieve this.
a) First combination: 
25 ft/s for 10 seconds

b) Second combination: 
5 ft/s for 50 seconds

are you multiplying cos(a) and sin(a) and so on in each box or what.

Thank you,
Rohit

"Hw 31-1","Dear Mr. Madhavan,

 

 

1. The range of a stone thrown at an angle A with a velocity of 100 fps is 1.5 times the maximum height reached.

  a) What is that angle?  Show the steps.
69.44395478

 

 

  b) What are the range and max height?

                   10.212 feet, and 0.026 feet

 

 

 

 

2. Radians:  As mentioned briefly in class, radian is an alternative measure of an angle; it is defined in terms of natural relationships between the length of an arc and the radius, just like π is defined in terms of the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter.

 

One radian is the angle that an arc subtends (new word;  makes) at the center of a circle, where the length of the arc is the same as the radius of the circle.



So, what is 360 degrees in radians? This is the angle traced, for example, by the hour hand in a 12-hour period, or by the minute hand over 60 minutes;  the angle in radians is the length of the arc all the way around the circle divided by the radius, r.

So, this angle = 2πr/r = 2π radians.

So, 180 degrees equals half a full circle or π radians.

So, if π radians equal 180 degrees, 1 radian would equal 180/π degrees, or 57.2958... degrees, or 57.30 to two decimals.   This leads to the following degrees to radians equivalents: 

30 degrees = π/6 radians; 45 = π/4 radians; 60 = π/3; 90=π/2; 120=2π/3; 135=3π/4, 180=2π, etc.

In your table.

 

3. Create a table to show sin, cos and tan values for angles 0 to 90 in 15 degree increments, showing the angle in degrees as well as in radians, expressed in terms of π (in other words, do not substitute for π).  Values are not to be looked up, but calculated, based on the values you already know (sin 30 = 1/2; sin 45 = 1/√2 or 0.707; sin 60 = √3/2 or 0.866; sin 90 = 1) and the formulas for sin/cos/tan of the sum or difference of two angles. Values founded to four decimals.

"Hw 33-2 ","Dear Mr. Madhavan,






1. How many rows are in the corner section of a stadium containing 
2040 seats if the first row has 10 seats and each successive row has 4 
additional seats?



2. A ball is dropped from a height of 30 inches. Each time it strikes the
 ground, it bounces up to 0.8 of the previous height.
a. What height will the ball bounce up to after it strikes the ground for 
the third time?
15.36 ft.
b. What is the height after it strikes the ground for the nth time?
(0.8^n) x 30
c. How many times does the ball need to strike the ground before its 
height is less than 6 inches?  See if you can solve this in two different 
ways.

d. What total distance does the ball travel before it stops bouncing?

10,000 ft.


3. What is the max range if angle and velocity are numerically equal?  
This is repeated from HW 32-1.  You'll recall the full solutions had an 
extended discussion, without giving away the solution.

a) Solve it by calculating range for V and A in increments of 5 from 
45 to 75.  
these angles do not work
Can you (edit): ""tell"" why 45 is not the answer.  Look for patterns
it is not because when you plug it in it does not work
b) Plot range against V and A being the same.  This may be a one-minute 
exercise!
I did 


4. What combination of velocity and angle, both being numerically the 
same, would result in max height and range being equal to each other?
This is the same as the last question, there is no solution


5. a) Develop the identity for tan(a+b) using the identities for sin(a+b) 
and cos(a+b).
(TanA +TanB) / (1-TanA Tan B)
    b) From the known values of tan 30 (=1/√3) and tan 45 (=1), find 
tan 75.  
help
6. a) Find sin 75 and sin 15 using the sin(a+b) and sin(a-b) identities.
help
    b) Find cos 75 and cos 15 from the cos(a+b) and cos(a-b) identities.
Don't take the shortcut by saying cos(75) = sin of its complement or 
sin 15, etc.  While that is true, I would like you to use the sum and 
difference identities for practice.
0.259, 0.966
7.  Use the Mclaurin series to calculate sin 6 and cos 10 
(up to four terms or iterations).  I am sending you separately the 
table we reviewed last class. along with some notes.
help



8. a) Create a table of trig values for the three basic functions of sine, 
cosine and tangent for these angles: 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 76 and 90.   
Express angles in degrees and radians.  No look-ups. 
 Develop these values from first principles,
 including 30, 45 and 60. Hint: use special triangles.


help


   b) Describe the behavior of the three ratios as the angle 
increases from 0 to 90.
they get closer to one


9. You and your friend are standing on the ground 50' away from 
each other at the foot of two walls. Your wall is 64' tall, while the 
other wall is 32' tall.  Each of you throws a ball to another friend at 
the top of the wall facing you, such that the person is at the vertex of 
the parabola that the ball traces.  Note that there are four of you, 
two throwers and two catchers.
This does not make sense. Are you throwing from on top of 
the wall or at the wall or directly to the person


10. a) Find the roots of x^4 - 14x^3 + 71x^2 - 154x + 120.  
The roots are all real.
x = 2,3,4,5
After doing work I checked using desmos, also, I remember
you giving the same equation so long ago!


     b) Find all local and global minima and maxima.
      (3.5,0.5625)   = maximum
       (2.382, -1) ,   (4.618, -1)

Appointment Reminder


NEW APPOINTMENT PROCEDURES AND CONSENT- Please read below information thoroughly. Confirming appointment acknowledges that you have read/understand this information and new procedures.

Our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, staff, and community. While cleanliness and sanitation has always been a primary part of our routine, we are putting in place increased and redundant sanitation procedures. We ask for your patience while we follow our disinfecting protocol.

NEW STEPS FOR APPOINTMENTS:

1. Upon arrival to parking lot, please text 703-722-2900 to let us know you're outside, and we'll let you know when the patient can come inside our office. Please arrive 5 minutes before your appointment time. Late arrivals may be asked to reschedule. If your appointment is on the weekend, please come into our office at your actual appointment time, and do not text from parking lot, as we have limited weekend staff

2. For patients under 18 years old, we ask that only 1 parent accompany them, no other family members. We ask this parent to wait in the hallway, as we have limited waiting room seating due to the need for social distancing. Adult patients should come alone.

3. We encourage patient to wash hands in hallway bathroom, then check in with front desk

4. Anyone entering office should wear a face mask or face covering

5. Anyone entering office should not wear gloves, please dispose of before entering

6. Walk-in appointments are not allowed, must be confirmed ahead of time with front desk staff

7. We will proactively schedule your next appointment for you, and are happy to reschedule by phone or text if a different day/time is needed. We will not schedule appointments at the front desk. Please understand that your next appointment will be scheduled at a farther date than usual due to the number of rescheduled appointments over the past 6 weeks.

CONSENT TO DENTAL TREATMENT AT THIS TIME

* I understand that the COVID-19 virus has a long incubation period during which carriers of the virus may not show symptoms and still be highly contagious. It is impossible to determine who has it and who does not, given the current limits in virus testing.

* Dental procedures create air and water spray. It is unclear as to how long the ultra-fine nature of the spray/aerosol may linger in the air, which can transmit the COVID-19 virus.

* I understand that the CDC recommends social distancing of at least 6 feet, and this is not possible with dentistry.

* I confirm that I/patient/household members have/has not had any of the following symptoms of COVID-19 listed here within the past 14 days: fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, body aches, diarrhea and/or vomiting, loss of sense of taste/smell.

* I verify that I/patient/household members have/has not traveled outside the United States or domestically within the United States by commercial airline, bus, ship, or train within the past 14 days.




Rohit's appointment is in our South Riding office on Thursday, June 4, 2020 at 4:20 PM.

Please click ""Confirm Appointment"" above. Confirming appointment acknowledges that above notice has been read and understood, and that the adult accompanying minor child will follow the appointment protocol.

Kindly give our office 48 hours notice for cancellations so that we may reserve another appointment for you and offer this reservation to another patient. Please email, call, or text us at 703-722-2900 with any questions.

	You invested $500 and received $650 after three years. What had been the interest rate?

	 

	 

	You have $50,000 to invest, and two funds that you'd like to invest in. The You-Risk-It Fund (Fund Y) yields 14% interest. The Extra-Dull Fund (Fund X) yields 6% interest. Because of college financial-aid implications, you don't think you can afford to earn more than $4,500 in interest income this year. How much should you put in each fund?

Hello all!

 

We are writing to welcome you to the Python and Data Science class, taught by Sanjana Hajela and Eric Kharitonashvili. This class is two weeks - we will spend the first week teaching the fundamentals of Python, and then the second week applying it to Data Science projects. Class will be every weekday from 2-5pm EST, and we plan on using the time lecturing and completing coding activities based on different Python topics. Zoom will be used for the lectures, and we will send out one master Zoom link that is used every day. We will also be using PyCharm and Jupyter notebook to code.





We will be sending emails after every class which includes additional practice problems and other information, so if a student needs to receive these emails at another email address, please let me know! I will add them to the listserv. 





We would like everyone to be prepared with the software we will be using. I have attached two pdfs to this email that give installation instructions for PyCharm, Python, and Jupyter Notebook. Please read through them carefully and follow the steps to get set up. Be mindful of whether you need to install a version for Mac, Windows, or Linux. Please reach out to either of us if you are running into any issues. 





We look forward to meeting on Monday! We would like to start off the class getting to know everyone, so please be prepared to introduce yourself and tell us your favorite pizza toppings, as well as your experience with Python (if any) and why you decided to take this class!

	Online Verification began on Friday, August 28th.  As of noon on Monday, August 31st, nearly half (41,375) of LCPS students have been verified by their families.  We wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for making this a priority.  

	If you have not yet verified your student’s information, please follow the instructions, FAQs, and video <https://www.lcps.org/Page/229648>  as well as tips below.  As a reminder, online verification should be completed by September 25, 2020. 

	1.	Online Verification only needs to be completed by one parent/guardian for each student
	2.	The Online Verification process must be completed in a web browser (portal.lcps.org <http://portal.lcps.org> ), not on the mobile PVUE app.
	3.	If you receive a red message regarding “Open Enrollment is not available at this time…”, please log out of ParentVUE, clear your browser cache <https://clear-my-cache.com/en/windows.html> , and log back into ParentVUE.
	4.	If you are prompted to verify data for a student who will not be attending LCPS for the 2020-2021 school year, please reach out to your school for assistance.
	5.	Families who filled out a 2020-2021 Online Registration request previously do not need to submit an Online Verification, as their information was recently reviewed during Online Registration.
		     a.  Families are welcome to log into ParentVUE, select the Student Info         menu, and review/edit any information requiring updates on that page.
	6.	If you have forgotten your ParentVUE password, refer to the Reset Password with ParentVUE Web and App <https://www.lcps.org/cms/lib/VA01000195/Centricity/domain/17270/pvue_help_docs/PVUE_Reset_Password_PXP2_ENG.pdf>  PDF.

	Thank you again for making this process a priority.

Hello parents and students, 

I realized that this email did not get out to everyone on my list, so I apologize for the delay. I am emailing to let you know we are issuing a new system for 3on1's. All 3on1's will have the same link to access, which I have below. 

Join Zoom Meeting--- https://zoom.us/j/2980053454

Meeting ID: 298 005 3454

Please keep this email handy as I will no longer be emailing 3on1 reminders daily. Students will be expected to email me their essays at least 15 minutes before their session. They can still email me at amber.n.beach@gmail.com <mailto:amber.n.beach@gmail.com> .

Also, please be noted that I expect students to show up on time. If a student is more than 5 minutes late to a session, they will not be allowed to join that session. 

Thank you for your help. Please email me if you have any questions.

Based upon the School Board Work Session discussion on October 6, the school board concensus was that testing (Quant-Q, ACT Aspire Reading and Science) will be eliminated for this year, the application fee will be eliminated and there will be an increase in student enrollment at TJHSST. We do not have a window for the application process at this time. The next scheduled School Board Work Session to discuss additional changes is currently set for November 17.","

"Rohit Kulkarni - Excalibots (First Lego League) ","Dear Mrs. Frank,


My name is Rohit Kulkarni. I am a part of the Excalibots, a team of seventh and eight graders from LCPS, Loudoun County, Virginia, that is participating in this year’s First Lego League Challenge. As part of this year’s challenge, we are to identify a problem with exercising and healthiness, and design a solution to enhance the overall fitness in our community.


To understand the constraints that are preventing people from improving their fitness, we researched and found that the root causes were a lack of time, cost associated with buying exercise equipment/gym membership, and an absence of motivation. We also found that many activities that take up large portions of the day require people to sit and wait. 


To address this problem, we have developed the Sit-Fit, which is an exercise machine that can be installed under the benches in public places. It provides opportunities for people in the community to exercise while people are waiting for a bus, sitting and supervising kids playing in the park etc. The Sit-Fit uses an assortment of springs and pulleys as the exercise, a reward system for motivation, and can easily be installed in our community. Our solution will help improve overall fitness in the community by solving problems like lack of exercise, affordability, and motivation to get fit.


Attached is a presentation detailing the Sit-Fit. Is it possible for us to get some input from you regarding our solution? Will you be able to spare some time so our team can meet you virtually and share our solution and get your feedback?


Thank you so much!

Good Afternoon,

Can you believe that we are beginning the process of selecting courses for High School??? I wanted to give a “heads up” about the course selection process and how we will be rolling that out for our Rising 9th grade students. More detailed information will follow!

Tuesday January 12th

*	Starting tomorrow you will be able to log into ParentVue and see what your child has been recommended for (4 core classes and World Language). You will not be able to change a teacher recommendation in ParentVue. If you have a concern about a course recommendation, please contact your child’s teacher for more information. We will all work together to come up with the best placement for your child.

February 8th -10th

*	On Monday Feb 8th at 10am Champe HS Counselors will be meeting with our rising 9th grade Champe students for course selection. Tuesday February 9th and Wednesday February 10th Freedom HS Counselors will be going into your child’s Resource class to go over course options for next year and help them select electives. You will be able to log into ParentVue from Feb 8th -February 26th to make any changes you would like to your child’s electives (directions will come in a separate email closer to this date). After February 26thplease contact your child’s current counselor directly to make any changes you would like to your child’s schedule.

**Please keep in mind there will be no course changes after June 11, 2021.

What can you do now? Start talking to your student about their courses! 

*	Attend the Freedom HS Rising 9th Grade Parent Night, Wednesday, January 13 @ 7pm.

From 7:30-8pm, we will allow students and parents time to review the Curriculum Presentations added to our website. After this window of time, from 8-8:30pm, we will have open Google Meet’s where students and parents can ask clarifying questions to our teachers and department chairs. These Google Meet’s will be separated by Grade Level, with additional Google Meet’s for our Elective Subjects.  For security reasons, you must login using your LCPS.org account. So, if your student has practice or work tonight, make sure you get their login information ahead of time, if you do not already have it.

	If you are unable to attend this evening, Curriculum Night will be recorded.

Students should report to the cafeteria @ 8:30 am on one of those 2 dates. Please note that masks and social distancing will be enforced. Upon arrival, student temps will be taken, and they will be asked to complete the Symptom Tracker Questionnaire.

		Dear Mrs. Kenworthy, 

		 

		It has been brought to my attention that the TJHSST admissions test date will conflict with the date of the writing SOL. I would like to know if there is an alternate test date that will be provided or another solution entirely. Have a great evening!

		User Name: B012293

		Applicant Name: Kulkarni, Rohit Praveen

		 

		Dear Applicant & Parent,

		Thank you for your interest in Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST). Please read this message in its entirety. Students will be taking a virtual exam on Monday, March 15th. You are expected to be available to take the exam. Applicants approved with the alternate test date will be tested on April 12th. Applicants with accommodations will be notified the week of March 8th if their testing date will be moved to the alternate date in April. You will receive additional reminder emails throughout this process. Missing the Student Portriat Sheet (SPS) and the Problem-Solving Essay Administration for any reason besides illness (verified by a doctor’s note) is not a reason to be eligible for the make-up test date or for an appeal. These decisions are final.

		GPA Review

		The admissions office is currently in the process of validating the applicant’s GPA to ensure each applicant meets the required 3.5 GPA in their core academic classes. In the event you did NOT meet the required 3.5 GPA, we will communicate with you via email next week. The email will indicate that the GPA was not met, and you will not be permitted to move forward with the application process. For clarification, this means you will not participate in the SPS/Essay on your assigned test date. Since the GPA review process is not completed, all applicants are encouraged to participate in the optional sample test session (see next section).

		Grades are still being received from our various schools, so this notification will be released as soon as we are able to validate all grades.

		Monday, March 8, 2021 – OPTIONAL but Strongly Encouraged

		A sample test session will be provided to all applicants. The purpose of the session is to make sure your computer is ready for your assigned test day as well as to provide the applicant the opportunity to “mirror” what they will see on test day when logging in. The practice session is designed to replicate the test mechanics ONLY. The login process is expected to last for 5-10 minutes, but we are provided a larger window for each group of students. Students will login and review the design of the system, questions (sample only), along with answer sections and submission process. Students will be assigned to sample sessions based on the first letter of your last name.

		*	A – G: Test Session 9:00-9:30am
		*	H – O: Test Session 9:45-10:15am
		*	P – Z: Test Session 10:30-11:00am

		Applicants will be provided an email on Monday morning (at 8:30am) with more information to include video directions, support information and link. Applicants will not need to spend the entire time online with the sample session. However, we strongly encourage all students to login at your designated start time (based upon the first letter of your last name) to ensure you can access the system prior to the actual exam date. Important: Applicants will need their applicant username (listed above) along with their password to login.

		In preparation for Monday’s sample test session and the SPS/Essay admininstration on March 15th, applicants are encouraged to complete the following proactive steps to help ensure that all appropriate security updates and patches have been installed.

		*	Use the School Issued Device for testing (strongly encouraged) if you were provided one
		*	Reboot your device (ensures all updates are received on the device and doesn’t impact the device on the day of the exam) multiple times 

			*	After reboot leave school issued laptop on and connected to the internet for the entire weekend.

		*	Approved Web browsers 

			*	Internet Explorer
			*	Google Chrome
			*	Microsoft Edge Chromium

		*	DO NOT USE a tablet (iPAD, other), phone or another mobile device
		*	Ensure device is fully charged or plugged in
		*	If you encounter issues with your laptop over the weekend, or on Monday that prevents you from completing the practice session please contact your school to have the laptop issues assessed and resolved. 

			*	Please note in the communication that the student is participating in the TJHSST Admissions SPS/Essay Testing on Monday, March 15th

		 

		Monday, March 15, 2021

		The Student Portrait Sheet and Problem-Solving Essay will be administered to applicants beginning at 9:00am.

		*	Student Portrait Sheet (SPS): Test Session 9:00-10:00am - (4 Questions)
		*	Problem Solving Essay: Test Session 10:30-11:00am - (1 Question)

		All applicants will be administered the SPS/Essay at the times listed above for March 15th. Applicants will be provided with the emails on Monday, March 15th prior to logging into each test session.

		Additional information will be provided next week via email in preparation for the test date.

	*	Make sure to put forward the message that:

		*	you are strongly interested in computer science

		*	Understand high level math in programming

		*	Give detailed and specific examples from the code

*	Transition: as an aspiring computer scientist/machine learning researcher…

	*	The PACT program will help me with

		*	Learning critical algorithms for my future job

		*	Will improve problem solving skills

		*	Increase my mathematical capability

		*	Learn along with other like-minded individuals

		*	add a connection to story in the first section with the above 4 reasons
			

*	Conclusion: through the pact program, I will be one step closer to reaching my end goal of becoming a machine learning researcher and making a positive impact on the world.

"Research Statement (to be reviewed) ","Dear Dr. Turaga,

            I am Rohit Kulkarni, a freshman student at Freedom High School in Loudoun County, Virginia with an interest in machine learning and neuroscience, specifically mapping the connectomes of organisms. As an aspiring computational biologist, I hope to gain meaningful research experience to broaden my understanding of these major topics while learning how to conduct hypothesis-driven laboratory research.
             In my current biology class, I conducted a research project testing the effectiveness of different machine learning models on determining the gene family DNA sequences fall into. I found that a Naïve Bayes classifier, coupled with a Kmers algorithm to convert a DNA sequence into ‘words’, resulted in the highest accuracy. Learning something new about DNA and its structure, machine learning algorithms, and eventually drawing a meaningful conclusion continues to motivate me to further pursue research.
            During the First Lego League, my team volunteered to take care of a team member’s brother, who had autism spectrum disorder. I saw his inability to stay focused, likely caused by missing neurons in the long-distance connections across his brain. Over time, the need for an understanding of the human brain will grow exponentially. As an aspiring computational biologist, I am eager to contribute to the science that can lead to the discovery of the final puzzle piece in mapping organisms’ brains.
            To widen my scope of knowledge, I began learning about the brain and how scientists are working to map its complex structure. I was drawn to your research investigating the use of machine learning to reconstruct neurons. After reading your paper “Large Scale Image Segmentation with Structured Loss Based Deep Learning for Connectome Reconstruction,” I was excited to learn that the Mala method was able to successfully reconstruct segments of connectomes, from two unique species, with a high accuracy. Learning about this novel technique has made me eager to discover more about mapping neuronal connections through the means of data science.
            As an aspiring computational biologist, it is essential that I think critically when investigating complex systems. Being a part of your lab will allow me to expand on learning about the career-area I wish to explore, enabling me to pose meaningful questions, develop crucial programming skills, and solve problems with new perspectives, just as a great computational biologist would. I am looking forward to being a part of research that could be instrumental in understanding the intricate and sophisticated system that is the brain.

Subject: PACT 2022
To: Rajiv Gandhi <rajivg100@gmail.com <mailto:rajivg100@gmail.com> >



Dear applicant,

Congratulations! We are delighted to let you know that you have been selected to participate in the 2022 Summer Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thinking. The program, which will run virtually (we may also have an in-person component), will take place between June 27 - July 29, though the first day for your group (which we call ""Group 1"") will be Wednesday, June 29 (there is another group, ""Group 2"" aka ""advanced group""  that starts meeting on June 27).  Below are some important things that we want you to know.

1. Below is a tentative schedule of a typical day at PACT. Please note that while we will try to adhere to this schedule as much as possible, we may have to change the times on some days depending on the availability of guest speakers and such. We strongly encourage that students attend live sessions, but we will also be recording all lectures so that if a student misses out on a lecture for any reason they can watch it later. All times below are EDT.

9/9:30am - 11/11:30am:  lecture for Group II students (length of the lecture will vary).

11:30/11:45am - 1:30/1:45pm: lecture for Group I students (length of the lecture will vary depending on the topics covered). This lecture will almost always be by Dr. Rajiv Gandhi and we are likely to have lectures for 4 days a week (you should keep this time available for all 5 days).  If possible, we will try to begin this lecture even a bit sooner than noon since we may have some participants from countries where it is pretty late at night. We expect the lecture length to be appx 1.5 - 2 hours.

9pm - 11pm: help/review sessions which will be run by more senior students, who may be PACT alum, or students from Group II. These sessions may not happen every weekday and sometimes there may be multiple/parallel sessions on a weekday. Length of these sessions will vary (we expect them to be 75-90 mins long). These sessions are meant to reinforce concepts learned during the main lecture and answer any questions that the students may have. Attending these sessions will be  optional.

Occasionally we may hold help sessions over the weekend. We will inform the students about that, if it were to happen. Attending these sessions will be optional too.

Based on the above schedule, we expect all of you to keep 11:30am - 2pm free on all weekdays. On most weekdays during PACT we will have a lecture during this time period.

In summary, we will work hard and we will make you work hard! :)

2. This is an intense program and it will involve quite a bit of work, so just because it's an online program we don't think you should pack many activities in your schedule. To understand well the material that we cover you will need to spend time thinking and internalizing the concepts. The more you think, the more you will get out of the program and it will benefit you tremendously no matter what field you pursue in college. My lectures are interactive and I will ask lots of questions during the lectures and I encourage students to ask questions then. After that if there are still some questions you can always ask during help sessions. We may also provide an online platform where students can ask questions.

3. Please email us letting us know of your decision no later than April 8, 2022. If you decide to participate, we will need the following information from you by email.

- time zone or which part of the world will you be during PACT.
- email us the following information of a parent/guardian: name, email address, and contact number.

4. To confirm your participation please send us a payment of $1,700  no later than April 8, 2022 (for financial support, please see (5)). You can make the payment using one of the following options.

Deposit funds electronically to the following account (Zelle is the most preferred and easiest option -- if using it, please use the email: depthfirstfoundation@gmail.com <mailto:depthfirstfoundation@gmail.com>  ).

"Request for Guidance in Summer Research Opportunities","Dear Dr. Gandhi,

 

Good evening! As Group 1 PACT for summer 2022 is coming to a close, I would like to thank you for helping me learn so many of the concepts behind computer science. 

 

I am currently interning as a machine learning engineer at Trillion Technology Solutions, and while I was conducting Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset, I recalled the first lesson on graphs. This helped me design and understand a Markov Chain Model, which uses a directed graph to generate text. My presentation on my model also went well, so I would like to thank you. I have learned a lot of content this summer, and I hope to continue to apply these concepts in the future. The most important lesson I learned, however, is that I should enjoy the learning process. Thank you so much for helping me understand the value of learning and how I should go about learning a concept or idea.

 

Up till now, I have been learning a great deal about machine learning algorithms and how they function, as well as how to properly implement them. I was looking to get involved in research to learn more about the machine learning area, and how it could be used to benefit healthcare (computational biology research). Specifically, I was looking to learn more and devise a research project during the academic year, and then conduct research during the upcoming summer, and potentially beyond. I was wondering if it was possible for you to connect me with other professors who are currently conducting research in this area, or any related areas, to do so. I would really appreciate it if you could provide me with your guidance and direction.

 

Once again, thank you so much for everything you have done for me this summer, and I hope to learn from you again!

 

Best Regards,

Rohit Kulkarni

One: gently push up on the throttle. Two: ensure the pitch, yaw, and roll are balanced. Three: do not mess up. By the time I woke up, the clock read 7:00 AM. I quickly changed my clothes, grabbed a small cardboard box, and ran to my backyard. In the box was a drone with a small camera and a remote control that had a screen to visualize the drone’s perspective. I quickly set up a launch area and commenced liftoff. This was the first time I flew a drone. Recently, the security of drones, or UAVs, has come into question. As technology improves, so will the dangerous possibilities of drones, and by contrast, the potential of drones to have a positive impact. The topic of imposing limits on public drone usage has been debated for years, with no side being the clear winner. Heavy restrictions on the sale and use of UAVs can hinder the enormous potential drones possess to make a positive impact in almost every industry, however with non-limiting regulations to improve security, progress can be made.

            Without strict regulations, drones can be developed further, allowing for continued advancements in technology to defend against drone attacks. This pattern is evident in various areas of technology. For example, Linux is an open-source operating system; there are no limitations on altering the software or viewing the source code.  Linux was developed in the early 1900s and is continuously updated with almost 200 changes every week to protect and improve the operating system (Citation 1). This software, which is completely open for the public to use and edit, is also utilized by the U.S. Navy’s submarine fleet (Citation 1). A lack of strict regulations on Linux has a negligible effect on its security and is a primary reason why the U.S. government utilizes it. Similarly, if UAVs did not have strict regulations on usage, advancements in the technology can be made by the public and “white hat hackers” can minimize threats and potentially dangerous issues with drones.

"Re: Governors school partial essay","           One: throttle. Two: balance. Three: do not mess up. By the time I woke up, the clock read 7:00 AM. I changed my clothes, grabbed a small cardboard box, and ran outside. In the box was a drone with a camera as well as a controller. This was the first time I flew a drone. As technology improves, the ability for drones to benefit the world increases. The topic of imposing limits on public drone usage has been debated for years, with no side winning. Heavy restrictions on the sale and use of UAVs can hinder the potential drones possess to make a positive impact in almost every industry, however with non-limiting regulations to improve security, progress can be made in a safe manner. 

Drones and UAVs have a wide range of applications in the public and are currently helping power several industries worldwide. Drones have an invaluable role in farming; helping plant seeds and cultivate crops. In 2019, the TeamTrees organization utilized drones to plant trees. Planting crops through drones is currently being researched: statistics show that drones save 30% of farmers’ time (Citation 3). Additionally, drones have been used to document areas where humans do not have the ability to reach, such as in extreme environments. Heavy restrictions on drones could create a barrier to both agriculture and developments in scientific research.

Without strict regulations, drones can be developed further, allowing for continued advancements in technology to defend against drone attacks. Linux is an open-source operating system; there are no limitations on altering the software or viewing the source code. There are almost 200 changes to Linuz every week to protect and improve the operating system (Citation 1). This software is also utilized by the U.S. Navy’s submarine fleet (Citation 1). A lack of strict regulations improves Linux’s security and is a primary reason why governments utilize it. Similarly, if UAVs did not have strict regulations on usage, advancements in the technology can be made by the public and “white hat hackers” can minimize threats by eliminating dangerous issues in drones.

            Although drones have numerous positive benefits, there are a few ethical and security-related concerns, like with any developing technology, so solutions must be found to ensure safety. With non-limiting regulations, drones can be utilized and researched by the public while avoiding potentially dangerous outcomes. The federal government could have an allotted time per-day where individuals in a specific region could operate UAVs. This would allow the government to isolate potentially dangerous drones in other regions. Innovative solutions can improve safety and the development of UAVs.

            Drones and UAVs have already shown their positive benefits in fields from agriculture to research. To develop this new technology, the public must continue research and testing, and to do so, drones should not be restricted to the government. Additionally, non-limiting regulations can be passed to improve drone-security. In the age of globalization, technology develops at a rapid pace, and new ideas should be embraced with cautious optimism.

	-       If restrictions, compromise and say:

	o   Prevent drones from operating at a certain time of day (possibly night time in each jurisdiction)

	*  Allow for government to have their drones running, etc

	o   Commercial drones cannot be equipped with dangerous or possibly dangerous things

	o   Force all manufacturers to software limit the speed of drones to a specific speed

	 Prompt:

	One: gently push up on the throttle. Two: ensure the pitch, yaw, and roll are balanced. Three: do not mess up. By the time I woke up, the clock read 7:00 AM. I quickly changed my clothes, grabbed a small cardboard box, and ran to my backyard. In the box was a drone with a small camera and a remote control that had a screen to visualize the drone’s perspective. I quickly set up a launch area and commenced liftoff. This was the first time I flew a drone. Recently, the security of drones, or UAVs, has come into question. As technology improves, so will the dangerous possibilities of drones, and by contrast, the potential of drones to have a positive impact. The topic of imposing limits on public drone usage has been debated for years, with no side being the clear winner. Heavy restrictions on the sale and use of UAVs can hinder the enormous potential drones possess to make a positive impact in almost every industry, however with non-limiting regulations to improve security, progress can be made.

	            Without strict regulations, drones can be developed further, allowing for continued advancements in technology to defend against drone attacks. This pattern is evident in various areas of technology. For example, Linux is an open-source operating system; there are no limitations on altering the software or viewing the source code.  Linux was developed in the early 1900s and is continuously updated with almost 200 changes every week to protect and improve the operating system (Citation 1). This software, which is completely open for the public to use and edit, is also utilized by the U.S. Navy’s submarine fleet (Citation 1). A lack of strict regulations on Linux has a negligible effect on its security and is a primary reason why the U.S. government utilizes it. Similarly, if UAVs did not have strict regulations on usage, advancements in the technology can be made by the public and “white hat hackers” can minimize threats and potentially dangerous issues with drones.

"essay gpt","Good evening everyone,

I come before you tonight to talk about a difficult topic - failure. As many of you may know, my friend Mithu has been struggling in her math class this semester. Despite her best efforts, she has not been able to pass her exams and is at risk of failing the class.

This news has come as a shock to all of us who know and care about Mithu. She is a bright and capable student, and it is heartbreaking to see her struggling in this way. But as difficult as this situation is, it is important for us to remember that failure is a natural and inevitable part of life.

We all experience failure at some point in our lives, and it can be a devastating blow to our confidence and self-esteem. But it is important to remember that failure is not a reflection of our worth as individuals. It is simply a sign that we need to work harder, learn more, and try again.

Mithu is facing a challenging situation right now, but I know that she is strong enough to overcome it. She has the support of her friends and family, and I am confident that with hard work and determination, she will be able to turn things around.

In the face of failure, it is important to remember that we are not alone. We all experience failure, and we all have the strength to bounce back from it. So let's all support Mithu during this difficult time, and remind her that she is capable of overcoming any challenge that comes her way.

Thank you.

1.	Provide the names of science, technology, computing, engineering and math courses completed/expected to complete by June 2023.



2.	Describe work/volunteer experience


I enjoy collaborating with others in the workplace, and also volunteering to better my community. The following is a brief list of my recent work and volunteering experiences.

This past summer, I interned at Trillion Technology, where I conducted research in reinforcement learning (RL) for health condition prediction. Interns were split into two teams: one for research and one for product design. I was tasked with leading my team to research the role of RL in predicting health conditions of patients using medical history and diagnostics data. A Generative Adversarial Network trained on synthetic medical history from the Synthea platform generated a “game” to train the RL model. This novel method, written using Python, Keras and Tensorflow, allowed the model to score an accuracy over 90%. Communicating with the other team, I integrated the model into the backend of the product. Interning at Trillion allowed me to experience long-term collaborative research and working with others in the workplace.

This fall, I was admitted to the Computer Science Honor Society (CSHS), which requires applicants to write essays and acquire a recommendation letter from a teacher. As part of CSHS, I volunteer every Tuesday in the school Academic Support Center, where I tutor students struggling in computer science and math concepts. Recently, I tutored a refugee student from Afghanistan, who was struggling with his Algebra class. Speaking with my tutee was difficult, as they were still learning English. With such a speaking barrier, I had to think of innovative methods to communicate with my tutee. A combination of asking yes/no questions, thumbs up, and how my tutee thought the problem should be solved allowed me to help them overcome their struggles with solving systems of equations. This experience helped me learn methods to effectively communicate my points with others.

Recently, as part of CSHS, I also volunteered at my school’s hour of code presentation, where volunteers taught students about chosen computer science topics for an hour. I was tasked with leading the data science presentation to introduce low-level Python programming for data science to attendees. I began by introducing students to Google Cloud Jupyter Notebooks: free Python Jupyter notebooks offered through the school’s Google Cloud subscription. Jupyter notebooks are tools that data scientists utilize for data analysis. Teaching attendees the basics of Jupyter notebooks gave them an introduction to basic data science. I also explained data analysis using Numpy and Pandas, two Python libraries for reading and extrapolation information from data. I made sure to include the Pandas “describe” function as it summarizes data statistics using standard deviation, mean, median, mode, and interquartile range. Volunteering to present basic data science topics bolstered my skills in data science and analytics.  

I am confident that the above experiences, my communication skills, as well as various collaborative efforts with my peers, will help me be a successful research intern in the ASSIP program at GMU.


3.	List Hobbies, Curricular and Extracurricular Activities and Leadership Positions:



*	Machine learning club founder and president (explain what it is)

*	Cyberpatriot platinum in states

*	Guitar (all state)

*	Model UN

*	Debate

*	TSA

*	MHS

*	CSHS




4.	Awards Received: 


*	Linkedin awards




5.	What do you hope to gain by participating in the ASSIP program and why?






6.	Describe an area of science, computing, technology, engineering or math that interests you and why you would like to participate in that research area:


I searched the pile of LEGOs desperately seeking an answer for how to build the dragon pictured on the box. As a dejected 7-year-old, I took the LEGOs to my older sister, who walked me through building the LEGO. She watched me execute the first steps, guiding me through the process. Her explanations gave me confidence to build the dragon and taught me that applying myself enables me to do anything.


The summer prior to 9th grade, my interest was piqued after reading about machine learning (ML). The possibilities of ML, from healthcare to transportation, motivated me to pursue ML. Through research, I learned that mathematics, programming in MATLAB and Python, and algorithmic knowledge are foundational for ML. My experience with Python programming pushed me to learn MATLAB through Mathworks’s course and earn a certificate. Practicing matrices, vectors, and derivatives on online platforms taught me these concepts. Stanford University’s ML course strengthened my skills; math helped me understand algorithms including gradient descent. I practiced ML by developing an univariate logistic regressor in MATLAB to classify spam emails.


Research in synergies between biology and computer science interests me. In 9th grade biology, my final project compared ML classifiers to locate genes in DNA. A kmers algorithm was used for a dataset of genes with fixed sequence lengths, written using Python and Tensorflow. Four classifiers were evaluated on the dataset; a Naive Bayes classifier, a logistic regressor, a Support Vector Machine, and a neural network. I presented the results to my class: the Naive Bayes classifier scored the highest accuracy of 98%.


Interning in the ASSIP program will help link my interests in biology and ML career-goals, providing me with a research-oriented learning experience in computational biology and machine learning. In a collaborative environment, I will conduct research with peers, bolstering my skills in ML and biology, helping me become a better researcher.




7.	Describe a creative idea you had on any topic. This can include but is not limited to how you creatively solved a problem or developed a new idea:


Recently, as part of the Congressional App Challenge, I developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered emergency healthcare platform. After researching online, I found that 15.6 million deaths occurred in low and middle-income countries across 61 conditions, according to an NIH article. 5 million deaths were attributed to low quality medical care 4 million deaths were attributed to health care issues. The NIH article suggested immediate medical action to reduce deaths. Such appalling statistics motivated me to develop an emergency healthcare platform.


I developed HealthVisor, an AI-driven, web-based application that allows patients to enter symptoms in a text-box. Inputs are processed using AI algorithms to extract meaningful symptoms and predict corresponding conditions along with their remedies. The application also connects the patients with doctors for expert treatment. To develop the web application, I researched methods to program a front-end, where I found ReactJS, a Javascript framework. Patients access HealthVisor through a web-application developed using ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to provide an intuitive user interface. Patient symptoms and patient geographical location, provided as text-inputs, are sent to the backend through REST APIs.

The backend was developed using Python/Flask API and feeds patients’ inputs to a Natural Language Processing based BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) algorithm to extract features, which are processed through a Deep Neural Network trained on 1 million data points. To generate such a dataset, I developed a novel Markov chain model, trained in five varying levels of English writing - from toddler to author. A custom Neural Network was trained on the resulting dataset that achieved an accuracy of 99%, and is the backbone of HealthVisor’s prediction engine, determining patients’ health conditions for the given symptoms.

The data layer consists of a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container and has a dataset that maps health conditions to remedies. The patient inputted symptoms are analyzed to predict top three patient conditions and remedies for each of the conditions. Additionally, the application queries condition-specific descriptions to explain other possible symptoms the patient may have. The 1UpHealth API is utilized to extract physician information based on criteria including geographical location. The system uses an intuitive user interface design to display predicted conditions. The top three predictions are shown intuitively through a clickable doughnut chart, and the diagnosis is given in bold at the top of the page. Further symptoms and remedies are also listed, along with suggested doctors to treat the patient.

Through this project, I not only learned about various programming languages and computer science concepts, but how to learn concepts in a time constraint for the competition. To succeed in developing an application with such a large reach, I was required to manage my time effectively between school, developing HealthVisor, and other extracurriculars. Quickly understanding ideas and concepts, as well as applying them in practice, is a critical component of hypothesis-driven research. My knowledge of the above programming, data analysis, and biology concepts, along with my ability to quickly grasp complex ideas, will make me a successful research intern in the ASSIP program.

"Request for Consideration in Your Lab - ASSIP Program","Dear Professor Stein,


I am Rohit Kulkarni, a sophomore at Freedom High School in Loudoun County, Virginia. I recently applied to the GMU ASSIP program and would like to conduct research under your mentorship.


Since my 8th grade, I have participated in the First Lego League, a robotics competition. During my 7th grade season, my team programmed the robot to complete a series of missions through Python, and scored the most points, helping us qualify for the world competition in Japan. My interest in robotics has motivated me to pursue computer science.


As an aspiring computer scientist, I am excited about the vast applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Recently I participated in the Congressional App Challenge, where I developed an emergency healthcare platform for personalized healthcare. A custom Markov Chain was used to generate data with symptoms for 41 diseases. This data was stored using a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container. I developed a Python Flask API to access the database, and a neural network was trained using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 99%. I added a method for users to access nearby doctors by querying the 1UpHealth API. Completing such a long term project motivates me to conduct hypothesis driven research in machine learning.


To widen my scope of knowledge in Machine Learning, I began reading about its applications in robotics. I was drawn to your research investigating the use of Deep Learning to predict properties of unknown spaces to assist with robotic navigation. After reading your paper “Learning Over Subgoals for Efficient Navigation of Structured, Unknown Environments,” I was excited to learn that the coefficients of a modified Bellman Equation could be learned through a Deep Neural Network trained on generated maps of the environment, allowing a robot to navigate an unknown environment it is not explicitly programmed to traverse. Learning about this methodology has made me eager to discover more about Machine Learning in robotics.


Working towards a career in computer science, it is essential that I think critically when investigating complex systems. Being a part of your lab will allow me to expand on learning about the career-area I wish to explore, enabling me to pose meaningful questions, develop crucial programming skills, and solve problems with new perspectives, just as any researcher would. I am looking forward to being a part of research that could be instrumental in real-time environment analysis through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

"Re: Request for Consideration in Your Lab - ASSIP Program","Dear Professor Boicu,


I am writing to you to check if you have any updates on the application that I had submitted for the ASSIP program.


My pursuits in computer science and artificial intelligence technologies has led me to participate in many programs, internships, and competitions, furthering my knowledge and skills. The following is a brief list of a few of my most recent experiences:


*	Trillion Technologies Solutions Internship (Summer 2022):

	*	As a Trillion Intern during the summer, I led my team to conduct research in the role of Reinforcement Learning in health condition prediction.  A Generative Adversarial Network trained on synthetic medical history from the Synthea platform generated a “game” to train an agent-based model. This novel method, written using Python, Keras and Tensorflow, allowed the model to score an accuracy of over 90%. From this experience, I not only learned how to apply complex machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms in industry experience, but I also learned how to manage a collaborative research project.

*	Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thinking (PACT: Summer 2022):

	*	Last summer I was selected for the PACT program, where I studied computer science concepts including graph theory, advanced probability, algorithmic time complexity, and basic calculus under Professor Rajiv Gandhi. This course is the equivalent of the University of Pennsylvania CIS 160: Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science course. My time during PACT taught me essential concepts ranging from binary trees to iterative optimization algorithms, helping improve my understanding of computer science.

*	Rock Ridge High School Phoenix Hackathon Runner Up in Senior Division (Winter 2022):

	*	I worked alongside senior classmates from Freedom High School and placed as the runner up for developing a fraud, phishing, and scam email detection and education application. I developed the neural network section of the project to classify spam, phishing, and fraud emails as well as the backend Python API through Flask. I utilized Tensorflow and the BERT algorithm to improve the accuracy of the model. Quickly developing such a project taught me how to effectively research and manage my time to develop a well-rounded project.

*	WACFL 5 Competition: Debate Public Forum 1st place (Winter 2023):

	*	Effectively communicating my points on labor unions and labor-related legislation as well as collaborating with my partner, in a constrained time to develop thoughtful and concise speeches on a technical topic, helped us place first.


I am extremely interested in the ASSIP program and I am passionate about conducting hypothesis-driven laboratory research in computer science. I am excited to apply my practical knowledge in industry-level computer science, theoretical and mathematical computer science concepts, speedy and thorough research, along with thoughtful communication and presentation skills through the ASSIP program.

	Dear Professor Boicu,


	I am Rohit Kulkarni, a sophomore at Freedom High School in Loudoun County, Virginia. I recently applied to the GMU ASSIP program and would like to conduct research under your mentorship.


	As an aspiring computer scientist, I am excited about the vast applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Recently I participated in the Congressional App Challenge, where I developed an emergency healthcare platform for personalized healthcare. A custom Markov Chain was used to generate data with symptoms for 41 diseases. This data was stored using a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container. I developed a Python Flask API to access the database, and a neural network was trained using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 99%. I added a method for users to access nearby doctors by querying the 1UpHealth API. Completing such a long term project motivates me to conduct hypothesis driven research in machine learning.


	To widen my scope of knowledge, I began reading about the applications of Machine Learning in different domains of technology. I was drawn to your research investigating the use of an agent trained on military data to generate comments on possible courses of action. After reading your paper “Rapid Development of a High Performance Knowledge Base for Course of Action Critiquing,” I was excited to learn that the Disciple-COA agent could successfully critique military courses of action using a statement translator, a COA sketcher, a graphical reasoner, and the nine principles of successful military missions. Learning about this novel technique has made me eager to discover more about agents-based methods of learning.


	Working towards a career in computer science, it is essential that I think critically when investigating complex systems. Being a part of your lab will allow me to expand on learning about the career-area I wish to explore, enabling me to pose meaningful questions, develop crucial programming skills, and solve problems with new perspectives, just as any researcher would. I am looking forward to being a part of research that could be instrumental in developing novel solutions through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.


	I have attached my resume for your kind consideration.

"Fwd: [GMU ASSIP] Interview with Prof. Stein","________________________________

From: Gregory Joseph Stein <gjstein@gmu.edu>
Sent: Thursday, March 23, 2023 9:44:22 AM
To: Gregory Joseph Stein <gjstein@gmu.edu>
Subject: [GMU ASSIP] Interview with Prof. Stein 
 

Good afternoon!

 

After reviewing your application for the George Mason University Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program (ASSIP), I would like to interview you for a potential summer opportunity in my lab. Interviews will be roughly 15 minutes each (over Zoom), during which I expect to ask you a few questions to gauge your interests (10 minutes) and give you an opportunity to ask questions of me (5 minutes).

 

Please fill out the following form to indicate your availability: https://forms.gle/B2AdnTiUXFjnRikf9 Available days include this Sat/Sun/Mon; if none of those work, please let me know! We can try to find a time later in the week as well.

 

*Potential Projects Overview*: In my lab, we think quite a lot about how to design decision-making agents (e.g., robots) that can behave more intelligently, particularly when they are missing information they need and must turn to machine learning to help fill in those missing pieces. Summer projects will involve working with modern machine learning (e.g., deep learning with neural networks) and experiments primarily in simulated environments, working under my direct supervision and additionally shadowing some of my PhD students.

A. Recently, some of my work has focused on how to make this decision-making process more reliable, namely that allow the robot to decide whether or not its predictions from learning are actually informing good behavior and whether it should continue to be relied upon. I envision that some exploration of this process, and how it can be used to make *domain adaptation* more reliable, will form the foundation of a good summer project.

B. In a similar vein, another project I have been working on has been in the space of *task and motion planning*, which is used to perform household tasks, like loading dishes into a dishwasher or set a table. We hope to use learning to imbue the robot with what we might think of as *common sense*. To do so, we need to expand our simulation environments in which we train and evaluate the robot's performance.

 

I have a video [1] (and a tangentially related blog post [2]) about some of these ideas; if you could watch through the video before we meet (even if you don’t totally understand it), it could help give you some context and an idea of what the summer might look like. Don’t worry if this seems overwhelming! I don’t expect you to have domain-specific knowledge coming in.     

 

Best,

Prof. Stein

"Request to defer ASDRP Summer 2023 admission to the Fall","Dear members of the ASDRP

My name is Rohit Kulkarni and I am a Sophomore from Freedom High School in Virginia. I applied to and was accepted into the ASDRP program for Summer 2023. I am very excited about the opportunity to be part of ASDRP program thank you greatly for this opportunity. 

Recently I became acquainted with a professor from George Mason University, which is located in VA and close to my home. He agreed to coach and supervise my research interests during this summer.

I reflected a lot on both the ASDRP opportunity and the option to work with the GMU professor.  After talking to mentors, I feel that working with GMU professor on site this summer, will prepare me better to be part of ASDRP program in Fall. My dream is to get a paper/poster published through ASDRP. The research training that I will get from my GMU professor will help me realize that goal through ASDRP.

I would like to kindly request that my ASDRP admission be deferred to Fall, and I am willing to commit to attending the program in Fall. Please let me know if this is feasible. ASDRP is 100% with my long term academic and research goals.

Thank you

Hi Rohit,

the ASSIP students in my lab will be working on various computational biology and bioinformatics projects. The topics for the projects will be selected by students in consultation with mentors during the first week of the program. You can get a better idea about the scope of research in my lab by looking at the sample papers listed below. The program will be completely online.

			Good afternoon!

			 

			After reviewing your application for the George Mason University Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program (ASSIP), I would like to interview you for a potential summer opportunity in my lab. Interviews will be roughly 15 minutes each (over Zoom), during which I expect to ask you a few questions to gauge your interests (10 minutes) and give you an opportunity to ask questions of me (5 minutes).

			 

			Please fill out the following form to indicate your availability: https://forms.gle/B2AdnTiUXFjnRikf9 <https://forms.gle/B2AdnTiUXFjnRikf9>  Available days include this Sat/Sun/Mon; if none of those work, please let me know! We can try to find a time later in the week as well.

			 

			*Potential Projects Overview*: In my lab, we think quite a lot about how to design decision-making agents (e.g., robots) that can behave more intelligently, particularly when they are missing information they need and must turn to machine learning to help fill in those missing pieces. Summer projects will involve working with modern machine learning (e.g., deep learning with neural networks) and experiments primarily in simulated environments, working under my direct supervision and additionally shadowing some of my PhD students.

			A. Recently, some of my work has focused on how to make this decision-making process more reliable, namely that allow the robot to decide whether or not its predictions from learning are actually informing good behavior and whether it should continue to be relied upon. I envision that some exploration of this process, and how it can be used to make *domain adaptation* more reliable, will form the foundation of a good summer project.

			B. In a similar vein, another project I have been working on has been in the space of *task and motion planning*, which is used to perform household tasks, like loading dishes into a dishwasher or set a table. We hope to use learning to imbue the robot with what we might think of as *common sense*. To do so, we need to expand our simulation environments in which we train and evaluate the robot's performance.

			 

			I have a video [1] (and a tangentially related blog post [2]) about some of these ideas; if you could watch through the video before we meet (even if you don’t totally understand it), it could help give you some context and an idea of what the summer might look like. Don’t worry if this seems overwhelming! I don’t expect you to have domain-specific knowledge coming in.     

			 

			Best,

			Prof. Stein

	Dear Professor Boicu,


	I am writing to you to check if you have any updates on the application that I had submitted for the ASSIP program.


	My pursuits in computer science and artificial intelligence technologies has led me to participate in many programs, internships, and competitions, furthering my knowledge and skills. The following is a brief list of a few of my most recent experiences:


	*	Trillion Technologies Solutions Internship (Summer 2022):

		*	As a Trillion Intern during the summer, I led my team to conduct research in the role of Reinforcement Learning in health condition prediction.  A Generative Adversarial Network trained on synthetic medical history from the Synthea platform generated a “game” to train an agent-based model. This novel method, written using Python, Keras and Tensorflow, allowed the model to score an accuracy of over 90%. From this experience, I not only learned how to apply complex machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms in industry experience, but I also learned how to manage a collaborative research project.

	*	Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thinking (PACT: Summer 2022):

		*	Last summer I was selected for the PACT program, where I studied computer science concepts including graph theory, advanced probability, algorithmic time complexity, and basic calculus under Professor Rajiv Gandhi. This course is the equivalent of the University of Pennsylvania CIS 160: Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science course. My time during PACT taught me essential concepts ranging from binary trees to iterative optimization algorithms, helping improve my understanding of computer science.

	*	Rock Ridge High School Phoenix Hackathon Runner Up in Senior Division (Winter 2022):

		*	I worked alongside senior classmates from Freedom High School and placed as the runner up for developing a fraud, phishing, and scam email detection and education application. I developed the neural network section of the project to classify spam, phishing, and fraud emails as well as the backend Python API through Flask. I utilized Tensorflow and the BERT algorithm to improve the accuracy of the model. Quickly developing such a project taught me how to effectively research and manage my time to develop a well-rounded project.

	*	WACFL 5 Competition: Debate Public Forum 1st place (Winter 2023):

		*	Effectively communicating my points on labor unions and labor-related legislation as well as collaborating with my partner, in a constrained time to develop thoughtful and concise speeches on a technical topic, helped us place first.


	I am extremely interested in the ASSIP program and I am passionate about conducting hypothesis-driven laboratory research in computer science. I am excited to apply my practical knowledge in industry-level computer science, theoretical and mathematical computer science concepts, speedy and thorough research, along with thoughtful communication and presentation skills through the ASSIP program.

		Subject: Request for Consideration in Your Lab - ASSIP Program 
		 

		Dear Professor Boicu,


		I am Rohit Kulkarni, a sophomore at Freedom High School in Loudoun County, Virginia. I recently applied to the GMU ASSIP program and would like to conduct research under your mentorship.


		As an aspiring computer scientist, I am excited about the vast applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Recently I participated in the Congressional App Challenge, where I developed an emergency healthcare platform for personalized healthcare. A custom Markov Chain was used to generate data with symptoms for 41 diseases. This data was stored using a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container. I developed a Python Flask API to access the database, and a neural network was trained using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 99%. I added a method for users to access nearby doctors by querying the 1UpHealth API. Completing such a long term project motivates me to conduct hypothesis driven research in machine learning.


		To widen my scope of knowledge, I began reading about the applications of Machine Learning in different domains of technology. I was drawn to your research investigating the use of an agent trained on military data to generate comments on possible courses of action. After reading your paper “Rapid Development of a High Performance Knowledge Base for Course of Action Critiquing,” I was excited to learn that the Disciple-COA agent could successfully critique military courses of action using a statement translator, a COA sketcher, a graphical reasoner, and the nine principles of successful military missions. Learning about this novel technique has made me eager to discover more about agents-based methods of learning.


		Working towards a career in computer science, it is essential that I think critically when investigating complex systems. Being a part of your lab will allow me to expand on learning about the career-area I wish to explore, enabling me to pose meaningful questions, develop crucial programming skills, and solve problems with new perspectives, just as any researcher would. I am looking forward to being a part of research that could be instrumental in developing novel solutions through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.


		I have attached my resume for your kind consideration.

		Sincerely,

		Rohit Kulkarni

		Sophomore

	Benefits of your ASSIP internship:

	Many professional and graduate schools expect two or more summer internships in a related area as evidence of your sustained interest, content knowledge, maturity, and skills. During ASSIP, interns engage in meaningful research, build their STEM identity and persistence, and have fun! ASSIP is unique in offering students an option to utilize their creativity and innovation during the hands-on Inventors’ Club 

	Mentors may provide their productive interns with recommendation letters and may occasionally offer co-authorship (if appropriate) for opportunities that arise following the ASSIP experience. With the mentor’s consent, ASSIP research symposium abstracts are published in the Mason Journal of Student Scientists’ Research and receive a doi (digital object identifier <https://secure-web.cisco.com/1Gt7yV1-vhk5TcUaW0wGdcYIRN8d67CEdsCIcEFIcqfKOqNfzZvnLorMRYODjITjMh0vWpOQMoFTzuxmNrHtzLyBhj0hp3Apbmc8GwO-Ec2Ho6A2axDokOUd-LYm8D0VfO7QKw6Bqqt__Q1PtTmz-jgO2Ue76Lrxk512K-oPlvRt8jP26yQE0Vfw13DdAemiRMh_swXCDnS3g4mln3pFWH7IPAyYI3LIVzO4wky9Unze-lPn8elpZUoxPcjqNjz5WhXwp6Msf0MbeVB3HpH25yMPalR99hXYt998ZSZ1Cxu0V_JGikJWj7bV0nrwtOj_MsZJW_pyjd440kRZexn8cEbePPrrBI3t4bE13dp_WsGgb76fJCUjdouITOfSS6tYR-mqEG_f9fV3PtYg2Prd1adoSO4mVZdehdnBsq0EzJmGmCPVLpVUOjGl-dYkLy42a/https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDigital_object_identifier%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DA%2520digital%2520object%2520identifier%2520%28DOI%2COrganization%2520for%2520Standardization%2520%28ISO%29.%26text%3DBut%2520every%2520time%2520a%2520URL%2Clink%2520to%2520the%2520new%2520URL.> ). ASSIP interns join a broad professional network of more than 1000 ASSIP alumni. 

	To accept or decline this offer.

	If you are clear on ASSIP mentor and organization expectations and requirements, in this email, “Reply all” to ASSIP (cosassip@gmu.edu <mailto:cosassip@gmu.edu> ) and to Dr. Mihai Boicu mboicu@gmu.edu <mailto:mboicu@gmu.edu>  to accept or decline the offer by 5 p.m. on Thursday, April 6, 2023.

	ASSIP understands that applicants apply to multiple mentors and/or multiple programs. However, it isn’t possible to wait for your acceptance pending your notifications from other mentors or programs. It is appropriate for you to reach out to other mentors of interest or other programs to check your acceptance status. It is rare for applicants to receive more than one ASSIP mentor offer. Do not accept this offer if you might later change your mind; that would be unfair to other equally qualified applicants. 

	By accepting this internship offer, you (and if a minor, your parent/guardian) agree that you will participate FULLY in all research and in the additional required participation listed above.

	We hope you will be able to join us for 2023 ASSIP!

Subject: ASSIP Welcome 
 

Hello,  




Congratulations on being selected as a member of George Mason University’s 2023 ASSIP Cohort. We are eager to meet you in person, and to kick off a summer of scientific discovery! We apologize for the late communication; if you have emailed seeking additional summer details, please read on. 




ASSIP 2023 begins on Tuesday, June 20th with your in-person orientation on George Mason University’s Fairfax campus. You will find details on the schedule for orientation, as well as parking and attire information, in the handout attached to this email. You will be introduced at orientation to the ASSIP Leadership team, be given logistics information for your summer of research, and receive all necessary safety training to allow you to work in your mentor’s laboratory starting on Wednesday, June 21st.   




What you need to do prior to orientation: Please be on the lookout in the next week or so for an email invitation to join Blackboard, a learning management system used by George Mason University. Please follow directions in that email to set up your Blackboard account. You will find in your account a series of forms you must complete by June 1st, 2023. Note: Any student who shows up to orientation without having completed their Blackboard forms by June 1st will not be allowed to continue as an ASSIP intern. These forms cover, among other things, liability for minors working in the lab; we are not able to host you without timely submission of these completed forms. Please feel free to contact ASSIP Team member Dr. Amanda Haymond Still (ahaymond@gmu.edu) and cc cosassip@gmu.edu if you are having difficulty filling out the forms or accessing Blackboard after receiving your Blackboard invitation email.  




We as the ASSIP team are so excited for you to join our program and be challenged to think creatively and address real-world problems through scientific inquiry over the summer. We will continue to send you additional information over the next couple weeks as we prepare to welcome you for the 2023 session of ASSIP. This will include what safety trainings you are responsible for attending during orientation based on the mentor with whom you are working.  




If for any reason your plans have changed regarding your ability to join us as a 2023 ASSIP intern, please reach out as soon as possible to ASSIP Team member Dr. Amanda Haymond Still (ahaymond@gmu.edu) and cc cosassip@gmu.edu so we can update our rosters.

No - I will not be attending

I am really excited to have been accepted to the Math, Science, and Technology program for the 2023 Summer Residential Governor's school. 


I had also applied to other summer internship programs and I have committed to a program whose deadline for acceptance was early April. I realize that Governor's school is a very valuable program, however I have committed to this program and that is why I am not able to attend. I hope to attend next year's Math, Science, and Technology governor's school. Thank you for the opportunity and your consideration.

"ASSIP Internship Questions","Dear Professor Stein,

Good morning! 


I hope you are doing well. I had a couple of questions regarding the schedule for my ASSIP Internship in your lab.

With the internship dates approaching, I was wondering about which days of the week would be in person and which days of the week would be remote.

I also wanted to clarify the building or location to which I would report on the in-person days of the internship.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
Rohit Kulkarni

	Hi all!

	 

	Sorry for the delay, I was away this past week and wanted to make sure to put together a few things before reaching out.

	 

	Welcome to the RAIL Group! We’re delighted to have you. We will do some more formal introductions over the next few days, but first some administrative items: your first day in the lab will be Wednesday. My office is on the 4th floor of the Engineering building on the Fairfax campus of GMU; see details in the link below. Let’s plan to meet there at 10AM (Ruchi: as you will be remote, we will find a time to meet later in the day.)

	 

	I have also CC’d my PhD students who will be your co-mentors for the summer and are in charge of the various projects that you’ll be working on.

	 

	The link below is a starting point for the summer. It contains some high-level information and over the next couple of days, my PhD students and I will populate it with some additional info for materials that you’ll want to take a look at. Until then, feel free to enjoy a few days off, and we look forward to seeing you all on Wednesday.

	 

	Best,

	Prof. Stein

	 

	Link to Notion page with more details: https://rail-group.notion.site/ASSIP-2023-20520eece8cf446cac0cb4ebfdec4b30?pvs=4 <https://rail-group.notion.site/ASSIP-2023-20520eece8cf446cac0cb4ebfdec4b30?pvs=4> 

	 

	P.S. I’ll be inviting you to our Notion workspace (where we take notes) and our Slack (how we typically message) over the next couple of days using the email addresses used here. We also use GitHub for code, so send me your GitHub ID (or create one) if you get the chance.

Hi Rohit,

My name is Chris Sun, and I am your Kaplan SAT tutor. I look forward to working with you!

It's my job to work with you one-on-one to help get your score where you want it. To accomplish this, we have our meetings but you should feel free to email me anytime. Let me know what I can do to help! 


Based on the availability provided in the student survey, would Tuesday, July 18, from 6pm - 7pm ET work for our first meeting? As per Kaplan policy, you have up until 24 hours before the scheduled session to let me know about any rescheduling...although of course as early as possible is much appreciated :) If this time works for you, please confirm in your response so that I can mark it in my calendar now!


All our meetings will take place here: https://kaptest.zoom.us/j/3741581756?pwd=ZFdkYWdQckVVUXBDeXlzMmRvaFVQZz09.



Before our session, please make sure you complete the following:


*	Because we are meeting in an online environment, check if you have a tech setup with a working webcam and audio.
*	Please complete your Kaplan Diagnostic Test before our meeting. If you won't have time to complete it before then, please let me know and we can work together to reschedule that first meeting.  

Thanks so much and I'm excited to meet you!

It's my job to work with you one-on-one to help get your score where you want it. To accomplish this, we have our meetings but you should feel free to email me anytime. Let me know what I can do to help! 


Based on the availability provided in the student survey, would Tuesday, July 18, from 6pm - 7pm ET work for our first meeting? As per Kaplan policy, you have up until 24 hours before the scheduled session to let me know about any rescheduling...although of course as early as possible is much appreciated :) If this time works for you, please confirm in your response so that I can mark it in my calendar now!


All our meetings will take place here: https://kaptest.zoom.us/j/3741581756?pwd=ZFdkYWdQckVVUXBDeXlzMmRvaFVQZz09.



Before our session, please make sure you complete the following:


*	Because we are meeting in an online environment, check if you have a tech setup with a working webcam and audio.
*	Please complete your Kaplan Diagnostic Test before our meeting. If you won't have time to complete it before then, please let me know and we can work together to reschedule that first meeting.  

Thanks so much and I'm excited to meet you!



Best,
Chris Sun

I hope you are doing well. I just wanted to reach out to you since I am unable to find the schedule spreadsheet. Would it be possible for you to check if it was shared with me?

Thanks,

Thanks for your patience - I've updated the spreadsheet with a potential schedule between now and when your school year starts. Please let me know how that currently looks for you. 

Best,
Chris Sun

"GMU Research Paper Journal","Dear Dr. Still,

Good evening! I hope you are doing well. As part of my internship, I would like to write a research paper documenting my project (in computer science). I understand that we are able to submit our abstracts, but I just wanted to reach out to ask if there was any peer-reviewed journal at GMU to publish a full-length research paper in order to achieve this goal. Have a great rest of your week!

Sincerely,
Rohit Kulkarni
